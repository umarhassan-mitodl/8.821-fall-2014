There is no required textbook, but there are several suggested books and literature reviews. {{% resource_link 725a6055-78d0-a6f7-9969-b3af54e85732 "Lecture Notes" %}} are available for each lecture.

*   Casalderrey-Solana, Jorge. _Gauge / String Duality, Hot QCD and Heavy Ion Collisions_. Cambridge University Press, 2014. ISBN: 9781107022461. \[Preview with {{% resource_link "b44e3eb9-53a4-4046-b3c4-3fccce8a2a47" "Google Books" %}}\]  
    A comprehensive discussion of applications of holographic duality to physics of the quark-gluon plasma.  
    Chapters 4 and 5 contain an elementary introduction to holographic duality, which I will partially follow. Part of this book can be found in {{% resource_link "7021b348-19b4-4f35-ace5-c59637eb653c" "arXiv:1101.0618" %}}.
*   Aharony, Ofer. "{{% resource_link "b7f12002-0573-425f-b2bb-83eaab0806fb" "Large _N_ Field Theories, String Theory and Gravity" %}}." _Physics Reports_ 323, no. 3–4 (2000): 183–386.  
    Classic early review, containing many background materials on conformal field theories and anti–de Sitter spacetime_._
*   D'Hoker, E., and D. Z. Freedman. "{{% resource_link "f332353a-7c4b-4b4f-a2a9-f457a3cfaba1" "Supersymmetric Gauge Theories and the AdS / CFT Correspondence" %}}." _High Energy Physics-theory_, 2002.  
    Contains many nice background materials on supersymmetric field theories and supergravity, and comprehensive discussion of how to compute correlation functions. The discussion of holographic renormalization flows is great.

    Chapter 23 contains a nice, short discussion of AdS / CFT.
*   Freedman, Daniel Z., and Antoine Van Proeyen. _Supergravity_. Cambridge University Press, 2012. ISBN: 9780521194013. \[Preview with {{% resource_link "eac6e00f-f21a-477a-abd0-9dee11cee64f" "Google Books" %}}\]  
    Part VIII contains a nice introduction to AdS / CFT.
