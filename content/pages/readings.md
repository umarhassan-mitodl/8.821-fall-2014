There is no required textbook, but there are several suggested books and literature reviews. {{% resource_link 725a6055-78d0-a6f7-9969-b3af54e85732 "Lecture Notes" %}} are available for each lecture.

*   Casalderrey-Solana, Jorge. _Gauge / String Duality, Hot QCD and Heavy Ion Collisions_. Cambridge University Press, 2014. ISBN: 9781107022461. \[Preview with [Google Books](http://books.google.com/books?id=WDeNAwAAQBAJ&pg=PAfrontcover)\]  
    A comprehensive discussion of applications of holographic duality to physics of the quark-gluon plasma.  
    Chapters 4 and 5 contain an elementary introduction to holographic duality, which I will partially follow. Part of this book can be found in [arXiv:1101.0618](http://arxiv.org/abs/1101.0618).
*   Aharony, Ofer. "[Large _N_ Field Theories, String Theory and Gravity](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0370-1573(99)00083-6)." _Physics Reports_ 323, no. 3–4 (2000): 183–386.  
    Classic early review, containing many background materials on conformal field theories and anti–de Sitter spacetime_._
*   D'Hoker, E., and D. Z. Freedman. "[Supersymmetric Gauge Theories and the AdS / CFT Correspondence](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0201253)." _High Energy Physics-theory_, 2002.  
    Contains many nice background materials on supersymmetric field theories and supergravity, and comprehensive discussion of how to compute correlation functions. The discussion of holographic renormalization flows is great.
*   Zwiebach, Barton. _A First Course in String Theory_. Cambridge university press, 2009. ISBN: 9780521880329. \[Preview with [Google Books](http://books.google.com/books?id=ih9kI9MEzh0C&pg=PAfrontcover)\]  
    Chapter 23 contains a nice, short discussion of AdS / CFT.
*   Freedman, Daniel Z., and Antoine Van Proeyen. _Supergravity_. Cambridge University Press, 2012. ISBN: 9780521194013. \[Preview with [Google Books](http://books.google.com/books?id=7ANrOHJLTjMC&pg=PAfrontcover)\]  
    Part VIII contains a nice introduction to AdS / CFT.
*   Maldacena, J. M. "[Lectures on AdS / CFT](http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0309246)." _High Energy Physics-theory_, 2004.
*   Polchinski, J. "[Introduction to Gauge / Gravity Duality](http://arxiv.org/abs/1010.6134)." _High Energy Physics-theory,_ 2010.
*   McGreevy, John. "[Holographic Duality with a View Toward Many-body Physics](http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2010/723105)." _Advances in High Energy Physics_ 2010, no. 3–4 (2010): 1–54.
