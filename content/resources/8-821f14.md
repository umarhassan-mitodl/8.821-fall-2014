description: In holographic duality, a quantum gravity system in a (d+1)-dimensional
  spacetime is equivalent to a many-body system defined on its d-dimensional boundary.
  The boundary system is referred to as a "hologram" of the bulk system. For more
  information about this image, see the syllabus section. Image by Prof. Liu.
